This small project's been made for a challenge issued by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iScy18pVR58&ab_channel=SebastianLague)
This has definitely been one of the most entertaining and fun projects I've worked on in a while! It's rare to be able to mix your favorite hobbies in a single project! ðŸ‘€

I'll be adding improvements and bugfixing from time to time, in the meantime feel free to explore the code.
